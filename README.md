SNHU, CS-230 - Operating Platforms

<p>
This course is intended to facilitate a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis
and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. The utilization of software design templates to solve
problems promote learning in this course.
</p>

<p>
All development in this course is conducted using Java.

#### Assignment 8-2

- #### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? <br>
<p> The Gaming Room is a gaming software company, with a flagship Android-only application - Draw It or Lose It. The Gaming Room requested consultancy to strike on the success of the game, and expand their market to a web-based platform of Draw It or Lose It. Requirements include creating a development environment to serve several platforms; namely, Mac, Linux, and Windows, and adding iOS smartphone devices as well. Notable requirements that were introduced and acted on in our Java solutions: Singleton pattern, to allow one game instance to exist in memory at a time, and Iterator patterns to quickly verify a game's respective teams, players, and id's exist uniquely - if not, instantiate.</p>

- #### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? <br>
<p>I feel throughout the course, and given feedback from the instructor, I performed very well in problem-solving via Java the problems that were introduced. Likewise, finalizing recommendations for architectural design, memory management, and development operationg platform of choice.</p>

- #### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? <br>
<p>The process forced me to deliberatley think about one specific requirement at a time, and while the totality definitely loomed, it was mostly in darkness. Which was great! I was able to not <i>have</i> to be concerned about my choices and think strictly about the best and most flexible approach.</p>

- #### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?<br>
<p>Most definitely the security recommendations. I believe that security recommendations and research require great time to extract a confident solution. Also, the field has great breadth, so it was difficult to feel my choice was the best. If I could do it differently, my approach would simply to carve out more time for research.</p>

- #### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?<br>
<p>From my experience, capturing user needs and interpreting them into code, or design, is one of the main keys to a successful product. Based on my knowledge and experience, I trusted in that to complete the process. It is incredibly important to consider their needs as their needs are exactly what you, as the developer (or whatever role) are solving. Maintain that lean scope creates a product the the client is happy with and can simultaneously extract more pain points.</p>

- #### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?<br>
<p>Simply, tackling each component one at a time, and stepping back through my own self-imposed iterations to refine and reduce previous solutions if I found a more suitable solve throughout the process.</p>
